# Agenda

- Going over figures

## Meeting Notes/Questions

**Aim 1: Diversity analysis**
- Figure 1: Observed, shannons, faiths PD (for faithâ€™s pd write phylogenetic distance)
  - Color code the alpha diversity box plots to match pCOA plots, p value 2 decimal points
- Figure 2: Bray-Curtis, Unweighted UniFrac
  -  Clustering in bottom Weidghted UniFrac plot is different from the top plot (wihout ellipses) - check if parameters are correct (change the code and see if a change occurs)
  - If the bottom plot turns out to be weighted then would be better to use unweighted because it shows an interesting clustering pattern
- Story:
  - Space samples: greater community richness and abundance, species seem more closely related
  - Ground samples: lower community richness and abundance, species seem less closely related 

**Aim 2: Differential abundance analysis**
- Figure 3. Taxa bar plots (different taxa levels: phylum, family, genus)
  - Can remove  titles for each graph
  - Sample IDs: just keep it as it is.
  - Change the order such that it goes (left to right) from highest to lowest taxanomic category
- Story:
  - The Spaceflight condition may have higher richness and eveness in species but they may be phylogentically similar -> which is why we see dominant taxa emerging in each taxanomic group
  - Typically Pseudomonas species are known for their high adaptability to different niches and can survive in low nutrient environments
  - The two dominant genera both end in "omonas" - likely from the same family/closely related

**Aim 3: Functional analysis**
- Figure 4. volcano, bar plot w/ pathways, PCoA
- Figures look good, keep the explanations from the presentation
- Investigate the pathways

**Things to consider based on our resutls**
- Seems that spacelifght selects for bacterial species that are better adapted to survive the harsh environments (and potentially pathogenic) which is deterimental to astronauts, as wounds are more likely to get infected

## Todos

- [ ] Make edits to figures
- [ ] Divide up parts of the manuscript among group members
- [ ] Write manuscript (follow the checklist)
