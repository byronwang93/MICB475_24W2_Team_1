# Agenda
- Discuss concerns w/ dataset
- Discuss specific research Q w this dataset
- Discuss what we'd like to explore (3-4 aims)

## Research paper:
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9761711/

## Dataset:
diabetic ulcers dataset

## Concerns
- small sample size, how can we cluster?
- some of the metadata have a lot of NA fields

## Research Question Ideas
Does sex influence the microbial composition of foot ulcers? (exclude the ones in space)
  - Only do the skin swabs
  - health vs ulcer (added element of sex difference)


## Aim Ideas
1. Does sex influence the microbial composition of foot ulcers? (skin swabs only)
2. Does space conditions affect microbial composition of foot ulcers? (tissue samples only, space vs ground control)
3. Does sex influence the microbial composition of foot ulcers in space conditions? (tissue samples only, space vs ground control)
4. Functional analysis (healthy vs DFUs samples)
   - disease progression? or potential?
   - biofilm formation
   - compare with a reference genome and identify differences -> if possible describe general functions/lack of function
     - eg. we noticed that these species were missing from these samples. could affect disease potential/progression
