# Mar 14 2025 Team Meeting

### Agenda:
- Submitted revised proposal
- Working on analysis, will ask questions/get feedback (depending on how much has been completed)

### Meeting Minutes:
- if have lots of pairwise comparisons, then do false discovery rates(?) but this doesn't apply to us
- Aldex2 code in progress
- documentation notes -> copy and paste into github
  - separate them by figures (each figure has the code used to generate figure)
- just need good format + structure + level of detail
- differential analysis -> boxplot vs heat map
  - set 1 as standard, 1 as experimental, heat map is good but might be overkill for 2 conditions

### Todos:
- [ ] have all data generated by next week
