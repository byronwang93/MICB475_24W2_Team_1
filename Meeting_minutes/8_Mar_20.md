# Agenda
 - Working on analysis (over halfway done), have questions/want feedback

## Meeting Notes
### Aim 1: Diversity analysis
- All good so far
- Set the axis to zero for some of the plots

### Aim 2: Core microbiome and indicator species analysis
- Prevalence threshold is too low (10%), should scrap this aim
- Can work on Aim 3 (do DESeq2)

### Aim 3: Differential abundance analysis
- During manuscript writing, mention what we did and suggest alternative methods in future directions
- no significant difference between ISS vs Earth samples so just present the top 10 most abundant ASVs

### Aim 4: Functional analysis
- Need to filter dataset first, to exclude samples where Spaceflight is Not Applicable
- Good results to work with, could look into sex differences

## Todos
- [ ] Complete analysis
- [ ] Create presentation
