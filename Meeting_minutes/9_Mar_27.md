## Meeting Notes/Questions

### Aim 1: Diversity analysis
- Shannon and Simpson's are same analysis but different scale - probabyly why we got the same p-value
- Results: Abundance - increase, Phylogenetic - decrease
- More diverse when comes to evenness, less diverse when comes to phylogenetic distance (spaceflight samples more closely related to each other)
- For Faith's, we can say there's a downward trend (one outlier data point that is affecting significance)
- For Beta analysis: 3 for ground is a big limitation (result of rarefaction) -> Do permanova (wilcoxson's doesn't work for beta)
- Figure 1: A) Observed, B) Simpson or Shannon, C) Faithâ€™s PD
- Figure 2: A) Bray-Curtis, B) Weighted UniFrac

### Aim 2: Differential abundance analysis
- No significant difference, likely due to small sample size (6 ISS, 6 Earth) reduces statistical power
- So instead generated top 10 most abundant ASVs -> but only resolved to 3 genus levels (Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, NA)
- For the plots, can't use abundance of raw counts -> need to look at average relative abundance
- Figure 3. Taxa bar plots (different taxa levels: genus, family, phylum)

### Aim 3: Functional analysis
- Pathways for breaking down common carbon sources (lactose, galatose, starch, etc.) is downregulated
- But pathways for breaking down niche (or less commonly consumed) carbon sources is upregulated (like toulene)
  - Interesting because these carbon sources are worse (hard to use)
  - Is it because these carbon sources are more readily available in space (or the common ones become less available)?
- AI could help with high-level observations of bar plot showing the top 15 pathways
  - Get rid of the middle 3 pathways that down trend toward upregulation or downregulation
- Figure 4. volcano + top 10 pathways

### Other notes
- Not worth doing DESEq2 differential abundance analysis anymore
- For presentation & manuscript, center the story around Aim 3 (the most interesting result)
- Make the theme of all the plots match (could assign a colour to each condition)
