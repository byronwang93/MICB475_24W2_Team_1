# Feb 28 2025 Team Meeting

### Agenda:

#### Proposal completed:
- PDF link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d8Pd0KtT512UcPfwP6cnKbmrvWJpILS0/view?usp=sharing
- Get feedback from Hans

#### Task delegation for manuscript:
- Aim 1 --> Sam
- Aim 2 --> Ada
- Aim 3 --> Jen/Byron 
- Aim 4 --> Troy

### Meeting Minutes:

#### Reminders:
- Don't have to stick to proposal
- Can resubmit the proposal after it’s been graded
  - Potential to gain 5 points back as long as we take the time to implement the TA's suggested changes

#### How should the instruction be structured?
- Not a lot of work being done on diabetic foot ulcers - hard to find existing literature
- Looked for articles to back up the obvious (i.e., comparing ground vs space samples)
- **Suggestions**:
  - Start with microbiome, then mention impact of diabetes on the body
  - See if there’s any literature that shows how there are physiological changes due to diabetes and how that affects the microbiome.
    - Ex: Increasing body temperature, skin changes
  - Look at how diabetes normally affects the body and whether disease progression/affect on the body changes in space
  - See if there’s papers explaining how space affects the body in general
    - Ex: Less movement → muscle atrophy
    - Ex: No showers → impact immunity
  - Then consider how does that affect the health status and microbiome
- **Takeaway**: If we can't find specific papers, need to make the links about the impact of our dataset analysis ourselves

#### Should we use ALDEx2?
- ANCOM is the same thing as ALDEx2, could use ANCOM instead
  - more people use ANCOM
  - Works in similar way in that it takes log ratios of microbes
  - Difference between these two methods is based on the control phylum used (maybe, need to check how it works)
- **Takeaway**: If there isn’t enough info on ALDEx2, it’s better to switch to ANCOM to ease the work burden of figuring out ALDEx2 on our own
  - Can switch at any point while working on the project

#### Proposed timeline & workflow (based on previous students’ experiences)
- At this stage there are 4 weeks until presentation week, so 4 meetings left: Mar 7, 14, 21, 28
  - Mar 21: Bring completed figures and ideas for presentation
  - Mar 28 (before presentation): Should have analysis done, bring a plan of the presentation (prep slides)
- Figures/results & story - most of the manuscript
- As we get the data from each analysis step, start making the panels for each aim - create them as they would appear in the manuscript
- Also try to include some bullet points for the results write-up

### Todos:
- [ ] Analysis kinda be done - Mar 14
- [ ] Analysis completely done - Mar 21 
- [ ] Slides done - Mar 28
