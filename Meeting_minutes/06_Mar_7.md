# Mar 7 2025 Team Meeting

### Agenda:
- Received proposal back so working on revising it this week
- Cover questions related to the proposal
- Dicuss edits per Hans' suggestions

### Meeting Minutes:
- For bioinfo work, should always cite all the tools used
- Microbiotia vs Microbiome: Microbiota is organisms while microbiome is genome but often these two terms are interchanged in literature
- Intro: First sentence with trivia fact is not as closely related to DFUs - can be removed as the next sentence provides enough context
- Hypothesis & Aim 4: Try to find other studies to back up the observations about Pseudomonas and Morganella in the original paper, if there aren't any then mention that there are limited studies in this field
- Grading: Based on whether we put effort into implementing revisions (don't necessarily need to agree with all suggestions)

### Todos:
- [ ] Work on revision edits and check over proposal by Mar 10
