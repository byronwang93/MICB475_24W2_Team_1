#### Data wrangling
- data wrangling notes updated in module_notes.m
- Paired end data, but class was single-end (changed the code)
- Line endings were a little different -> moved it into an editable file
- Closely in relation to class activities
- Demux File: average phred schore of 30
- QUESTION: How to trim? Reverse is better quality than forward (usually the opposite)
- 205 -> want an average phred score 30 or up
- Find the median percentile (look at the quality score at that position) -> still pretty high (keep the whole thing?)
  - Cut it like 230
  - Cutting it like 50 bps (forward and reverse do not have to be the same)
  - Cut it to be a bit longer -> (reasoning is alright, but if we cut out 1/5 of our entire sequence we are losing a lot of resolution, so more uncertainity)
  - Server has been clogged and a lot of backlog (took a longtime)
- Files too large to store on GitHub (store the latest ones on there) -> store it 

### Todos:
- [ ] Complete individual parts of proposal
